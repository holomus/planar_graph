### Dependency Management Strategies:

1. Maintain a comprehensive list of compatible dependency versions for each release,
   - At least **one** compatible dependency version must be present for new release

2. Adhere strictly to Semantic Versioning rules,
   - **Major Number** changes only when new version may break any dependant code
